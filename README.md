#CAAN-Drone App

CAAN-Drone App is an open-source project designed to streamline the process for drone pilots in Nepal to obtain flight permissions from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN). This app aims to simplify drone operations in Nepal, enhance safety by integrating real-time permission management, and provide comprehensive airspace mapping.
üìå Key Features
	‚Ä¢	Pilot Registration: Drone pilots can sign up and apply for flight permissions directly within the app.
	‚Ä¢	Airspace Mapping: Includes detailed maps showing airports, aerodromes, heliports, and airspace classes in Nepal.
	‚Ä¢	Manned Aircraft Coordination: Ensures safe integration between drone and manned aircraft operations.
	‚Ä¢	Foreign Pilot Support: Simplifies the process for international drone operators to obtain permissions for flying in Nepal.
üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
	‚Ä¢	Git
	‚Ä¢	Node.js
	‚Ä¢	React Native (for cross-platform mobile development)
	‚Ä¢	Google Maps API (for map integration)
	‚Ä¢	Android Studio/Xcode (for device emulation and testing)
Installation
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sujanshahi/CAAN-Drone.git
cd CAAN-Drone
2.	Install dependencies:
npm install
3.	Set up API keys:
	‚Ä¢	Obtain a Google Maps API key from Google Cloud, and add it to your .env configuration.
	4.	Run the app on an emulator or physical device:
